Hey. Hey, you!

This file is deprecated.

Are you attempting to use this with Nick Coutsos' keymap
editor (https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor)? If
so, make sure you have the "Enable Legacy Keymap" option
unchecked in the settings dialog. If you need help visit
the project's GitHub repository and create an issue:
  https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor/issues

If you're attempting to use this with some other keymap
editor, I would encourage you to reconsider.
